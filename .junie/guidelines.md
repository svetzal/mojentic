# Mojentic Development Guidelines

You must update this guidelines file (`.junie/guidelines.md`) when you learn new things about the user's expectations, especially if the user tells you to remember something.

## Project Overview

Mojentic is an agentic framework that provides a simple and flexible way to assemble teams of agents to solve complex problems. It supports integration with various LLM providers and includes tools for task automation.

## Identity and Branding Guidelines

As Mojentic is a Mojility product, it is important to maintain a consistent identity and branding across all materials. The following guidelines should be followed:

- **Logo**: Use the official Mojility logo in all branding materials. The logo should be used in its original colors and proportions
- **Color Palette**: Use the official Mojility color palette for all branding materials. The primary colors are:
  - Accent Green: #6bb660
  - Dark Grey: #666767

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Key Dependencies:
  - pydantic: Data validation
  - structlog: Logging
  - ollama/openai: LLM integration
  - pytest: Testing
  - MkDocs: Documentation

```

## Development Setup
1. Install Python 3.11 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. Install pre-commit hooks (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create a pre-commit hook that runs pytest
   cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOL'
   #!/bin/sh

   # Run pytest
   echo "Running pytest..."
   python -m pytest

   # Store the exit code
   exit_code=$?

   # Exit with pytest's exit code
   exit $exit_code
   EOL

   # Make the hook executable
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests are co-located with implementation files (test file must be in the same folder as the implementation)
- We write tests as specifications, therefore you can find all the tests in the *_spec.py files
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Linting: `flake8 src`
- Code style:
  - Max line length: 127
  - Max complexity: 10
  - Follow numpy docstring style

### Testing Best Practices
- Use pytest for testing, with mocker if you require mocking
- Do not use unittest or MagicMock directly, use it through the mocker wrapper
- Use @fixture markers for pytest fixtures
- Break up fixtures into smaller fixtures if they are too large
- Do not write Given/When/Then or Act/Arrange/Assert comments
- Do not write docstring comments on your should_ methods
- Separate test phases with a single blank line
- Do not write conditional statements in tests
- Each test must fail for only one clear reason

## Code Style Requirements
- Follow the existing project structure
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document using numpy-style docstrings
- Keep code complexity low
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Co-locate tests with implementation
- Favor declarative code styles over imperative code styles
- Use pydantic (not @dataclass) for data objects with strong types
- Favor list and dictionary comprehensions over for loops

## Mojentic Development

### LLM Tool Development

1. When writing a new LLM tool, model the implementation after `mojentic.llm.tools.date_resolver.ResolveDateTool`
2. For LLM-based tools, take the LLMBroker object as a parameter in the tool's initializer
3. Don't ask the LLM to generate JSON directly, use the `LLMBroker.generate_object()` method instead

## Documentation

- Built with MkDocs and Material theme
- API documentation uses mkdocstrings
- Supports mermaid.js diagrams in markdown files:
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Doc] --> B[Feature]
  ```
- Build docs locally: `mkdocs serve`
- Build for production: `mkdocs build`
- Markdown files
    - Use `#` for top-level headings
    - Put blank lines above and below bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, quotations, and code blocks
- Always keep the navigation tree in `mkdocs.yml` up to date with changes to the available documents in the `docs` folder

### API Documentation

API documentation uses mkdocstrings, which inserts module, class, and method documentation using certain markers in the markdown documents.

eg.

```
::: mojentic.llm.MessageBuilder
    options:
        show_root_heading: true
        merge_init_into_class: false
        group_by_category: false
```

Always use the same `show_root_heading`, `merge_init_into_class`, and `group_by_category` options. Adjust the module and class name after the `:::` as needed.

## Release Process

1. Update CHANGELOG.md:
   - All notable changes should be documented under the [Unreleased] section
   - Group changes into categories:
     - Added: New features
     - Changed: Changes in existing functionality
     - Deprecated: Soon-to-be removed features
     - Removed: Removed features
     - Fixed: Bug fixes
     - Security: Security vulnerability fixes
   - Each entry should be clear and understandable to end-users
   - Reference relevant issue/PR numbers where applicable

2. Creating a Release:
   - Ensure `pyproject.toml` has the next release version
   - Ensure all changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md
     - Move [Unreleased] changes to the new version section (e.g., [1.0.0])
   - Follow semantic versioning:
     - MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
     - MINOR version for backward-compatible new functionality
     - PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

3. Best Practices:
   - Keep entries concise but descriptive
   - Write from the user's perspective
   - Include migration instructions for breaking changes
   - Document API changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Running Scripts

1. Example scripts are in `src/_examples/`
2. Basic usage:
   ```python
   from mojentic.llm import LLMBroker
   from mojentic.agents import BaseLLMAgent
   ```
3. See example files for common patterns:
   - simple_llm.py: Basic LLM usage
   - chat_session.py: Chat interactions
   - working_memory.py: Context management

## Release Process

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for version numbering. The version format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:

1. MAJOR version increases for incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version increases for backward-compatible functionality additions
3. PATCH version increases for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Preparing a Release

When preparing a release, follow these steps:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Move items from the "[Next]" section to a new version section
   - Add the new version number and release date: `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Ensure all changes are properly categorized under "Added", "Changed", "Deprecated", "Removed", "Fixed", or "Security"
   - Keep the empty "[Next]" section at the top for future changes

2. **Update Version Number**:
   - Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`
   - Ensure the version number follows semantic versioning principles based on the nature of changes:
     - **Major Release**: Breaking changes that require users to modify their code
     - **Minor Release**: New features that don't break backward compatibility
     - **Patch Release**: Bug fixes that don't add features or break compatibility

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Review and update `README.md` to reflect any new features, changed behavior, or updated requirements
   - Update any other documentation files that reference features or behaviors that have changed
   - Ensure installation instructions and examples are up to date

4. **Final Verification**:
   - Run all tests to ensure they pass
   - Verify that the application works as expected with the updated version
   - Check that all documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project

### Release Types

#### Major Releases (x.0.0)

- Documentation corrections

For patch releases:

- Clearly describe the issues fixed
- Avoid introducing new features
- Maintain strict backward compatibility
