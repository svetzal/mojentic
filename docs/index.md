# Mojentic

Mojentic is a multi-layered framework that aims to provide a simple and flexible way to perform low
level operations with LLMs, apply simple agents to intermediate tasks, or assemble teams of agents to
solve complex problems.

Design goals are
- simple to use to do simple things
- provide an abstraction that allows you to flexibly work with multiple LLM providers
- instead of the popular directed-graph or delegation style agent formations, mojentic aims to provide an asynchronous pubsub architecture for agentic work

> The agentic aspects of this framework are in the highest state of flux.
> The [first layer](api_1.md) has stabilized, as have the simpler parts of the [second layer](api_2.md), and we're working on the stability of the asynchronous pubsub architecture.
> We expect Python 3.14 will be the real enabler for the async aspects of the second layer.

## Examples

The following diagrams illustrate key usage patterns in Mojentic. For detailed architectural information about agents and events, see [Asynchronous Capabilities](async_capabilities.md).

### Simple One-Shot Completion

Simple things should be simple...

```python
from mojentic.llm import LLMBroker
from mojentic.llm.gateways import OllamaGateway
from mojentic.llm.gateways.models import LLMMessage

llm = LLMBroker(model="llama3.3", gateway=OllamaGateway())
response = llm.generate(messages=[LLMMessage(content="Hello, how are you?")])
print(response)
```

This diagram shows the simple sequence from the above code.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant LLMBroker
    participant OllamaGateway
    participant Ollama

    User->>LLMBroker: generate(messages)
    LLMBroker->>OllamaGateway: complete(model, messages)
    OllamaGateway->>Ollama: API call
    Ollama-->>OllamaGateway: Response
    OllamaGateway-->>LLMBroker: LLMGatewayResponse
    LLMBroker-->>User: Response text
```

### Chat Session

This diagram shows how ChatSession wraps LLMBroker to provide a conversational interface with automatic message history management:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ChatSession
    participant LLMBroker
    participant LLMGateway
    participant LLM

    User->>ChatSession: chat("Hello, how are you?")
    ChatSession->>ChatSession: Add message to history
    ChatSession->>LLMBroker: generate(messages)
    LLMBroker->>LLMGateway: complete(model, messages)
    LLMGateway->>LLM: API call
    LLM-->>LLMGateway: Response
    LLMGateway-->>LLMBroker: LLMGatewayResponse
    LLMBroker-->>ChatSession: Response text
    ChatSession->>ChatSession: Add response to history
    ChatSession-->>User: Response text
```

### Asynchronous Multi-Agent System

This diagram shows how multiple agents process events concurrently using the AsyncDispatcher:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Dispatcher as AsyncDispatcher
    participant Router
    participant Agent1 as Analyzer Agent
    participant Agent2 as Summarizer Agent
    participant Agent3 as Aggregator Agent

    User->>Dispatcher: dispatch(TextEvent)
    Dispatcher->>Router: Route TextEvent
    
    par Concurrent Processing
        Router->>Agent1: receive_event_async(TextEvent)
        and
        Router->>Agent2: receive_event_async(TextEvent)
        and
        Router->>Agent3: receive_event_async(TextEvent)
    end
    
    Agent1-->>Dispatcher: [AnalysisEvent]
    Agent2-->>Dispatcher: [SummaryEvent]
    
    Dispatcher->>Router: Route AnalysisEvent
    Router->>Agent3: receive_event_async(AnalysisEvent)
    
    Dispatcher->>Router: Route SummaryEvent
    Router->>Agent3: receive_event_async(SummaryEvent)
    
    Agent3->>Agent3: Aggregate all events
    Agent3-->>Dispatcher: [CombinedResultEvent]
    Dispatcher-->>User: Final result
```
