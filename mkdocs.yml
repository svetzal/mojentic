      markdown_description: "Mojentic is an agentic framework that aims to provide a simple and flexible way to assemble teams of agents to solve complex problems. Design goals are to be asynchronous with a pubsub messaging architecture. Agents are the smallest unit of computation in Mojentic, responsible for processing events and emitting new events. Agents can be combined to form complex systems. Mojentic provides both synchronous and asynchronous event processing capabilities, enabling concurrent event processing for improved performance and responsiveness. This is particularly valuable for complex workflows involving multiple LLM calls or other high-latency operations. Events are the only way agents communicate with each other, supporting traceability and debugging of agentic flows."
